# Introduction
Docker is a platform for packaging, deploying, and running applications.
## What is Docker? And Why Docker?

The keywords of Docker are **develop, ship** and **run** anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

## Docker vs VM

Docker virtualizes the Operating System while virtualization of hardware is done while creating a VM. Unlike the VMs which can communicate with the hardware of the host, Docker containers run in an isolated environment on top of the host's OS.
