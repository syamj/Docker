# Introduction
Docker is a platform for packaging, deploying, and running applications.
## What is Docker? And Why Docker?

The keywords of Docker are **develop, ship** and **run** anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

## Docker vs VM

Docker virtualizes the Operating System while virtualization of hardware is done while creating a VM. Unlike the VMs which can communicate with the hardware of the host, Docker containers run in an isolated environment on top of the host's OS.
Compared to virtual machines, containers use less memory and less CPU.
