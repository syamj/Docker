Once completed, let's start docker and make sure it's running.

```
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl status docker
```
```
syamj@test-ubuntu:~ $ sudo systemctl status docker
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Tue 2019-10-01 11:14:47 UTC; 5min ago
     Docs: https://docs.docker.com
```
To check the version of the Docker.
```
docker --version
```
```
syamj@test-ubuntu:~ $ docker --version
Docker version 18.09.7, build 2d0083d
syamj@test-ubuntu:~$
```

Yay! Docker is started and running in our Ubuntu Machine :) 

Now to make sure everything works fine, run the below command.

```
docker run hello-world
```

While running this I got the below permission denied error.

```
syamj@test-ubuntu:~$ docker run hello-world
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Post http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.39/containers/create: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied.
See 'docker run --help'.
syamj@test-ubuntu:~$

```

Okay! Now to fix this, this is what I did.

- Open /etc/group file
- Add your username(syamj in my case) to the group docker

Now the group docker will look like below

```
syamj@test-ubuntu:~$ sudo grep docker /etc/group
docker:x:115:syamj
syamj@test-ubuntu:~$
```

Great. We'll try the hello-world command again. :)

```
syamj@test-ubuntu:~$ docker run hello-world

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

### YAY!! It worked :)
